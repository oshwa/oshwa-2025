While creating these documents through the lens of shared ‘Best Practices’, the cohort quickly recognized that their University structures, even limited to an American cohort, were so vastly different, that one set of best practices would not suffice. Some academics owned their research and others did not, some had a form of Tech Transfer Office and others did not, many spanned the landscape of positions one could hold at a University. Some had their Dean’s support in open hardware and others did not. Depending on these differences, “best practices” varied drastically. Some enabling practices may not be a one-size fits all solution, but our fellows and the universities they navigate represent a broad spectrum of American universities. We shifted the terminology to enabling practices to encompass more types of universities, where “best” would imply that one university type would be prioritized with which practices work in that system.</p>"}]},"buttonText":"Download","buttonUrl":"https://resources.oshwa.org/files/enabling-practices.pdf"}],"resourceImage":{"gatsbyImage":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"/_gatsby/image/1e8c4e88d9a7bc28374e7c0cbd78f3f4/1617fd6666d9cab28d0937e3e10342ed/enabling-practices-cover.avif?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F3e0cshhzqlmj%2F1Jjv4aaEu48Zr5Uh65txmH%2F442343df16e81912ec35fc6af1f18986%2Fenabling-practices-cover.jpg&a=w%3D150%26h%3D194%26fm%3Davif%26q%3D75&cd=2024-06-05T21%3A53%3A39.982Z 150w,/_gatsby/image/1e8c4e88d9a7bc28374e7c0cbd78f3f4/869bd1618c27e6d74352bf81db857729/enabling-practices-cover.avif?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F3e0cshhzqlmj%2F1Jjv4aaEu48Zr5Uh65txmH%2F442343df16e81912ec35fc6af1f18986%2Fenabling-practices-cover.jpg&a=w%3D300%26h%3D388%26fm%3Davif%26q%3D75&cd=2024-06-05T21%3A53%3A39.982Z 300w,/_gatsby/image/1e8c4e88d9a7bc28374e7c0cbd78f3f4/47b89e16a2aca8f88ff76019174dbd1e/enabling-practices-cover.avif?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F3e0cshhzqlmj%2F1Jjv4aaEu48Zr5Uh65txmH%2F442343df16e81912ec35fc6af1f18986%2Fenabling-practices-cover.jpg&a=w%3D600%26h%3D776%26fm%3Davif%26q%3D75&cd=2024-06-05T21%3A53%3A39.982Z 600w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/_gatsby/image/1e8c4e88d9a7bc28374e7c0cbd78f3f4/b0d7a6c91a492ad6a1cf0c744b0aab50/enabling-practices-cover.webp?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F3e0cshhzqlmj%2F1Jjv4aaEu48Zr5Uh65txmH%2F442343df16e81912ec35fc6af1f18986%2Fenabling-practices-cover.jpg&a=w%3D150%26h%3D194%26fm%3Dwebp%26q%3D75&cd=2024-06-05T21%3A53%3A39.982Z 150w,/_gatsby/image/1e8c4e88d9a7bc28374e7c0cbd78f3f4/57a873c4e042be1f46cc4ecde091be79/enabling-practices-cover.webp?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F3e0cshhzqlmj%2F1Jjv4aaEu48Zr5Uh65txmH%2F442343df16e81912ec35fc6af1f18986%2Fenabling-practices-cover.jpg&a=w%3D300%26h%3D388%26fm%3Dwebp%26q%3D75&cd=2024-06-05T21%3A53%3A39.982Z 300w,/_gatsby/image/1e8c4e88d9a7bc28374e7c0cbd78f3f4/59d7332372a4489c9cc679acfcc8ef8d/enabling-practices-cover.webp?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F3e0cshhzqlmj%2F1Jjv4aaEu48Zr5Uh65txmH%2F442343df16e81912ec35fc6af1f18986%2Fenabling-practices-cover.jpg&a=w%3D600%26h%3D776%26fm%3Dwebp%26q%3D75&cd=2024-06-05T21%3A53%3A39.982Z 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}],"fallback":{"src":"/_gatsby/image/1e8c4e88d9a7bc28374e7c0cbd78f3f4/a024d0fb63a69ec9e841435a690430b5/enabling-practices-cover.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F3e0cshhzqlmj%2F1Jjv4aaEu48Zr5Uh65txmH%2F442343df16e81912ec35fc6af1f18986%2Fenabling-practices-cover.jpg&a=w%3D150%26h%3D194%26fm%3Djpg%26q%3D75&cd=2024-06-05T21%3A53%3A39.982Z","srcSet":"/_gatsby/image/1e8c4e88d9a7bc28374e7c0cbd78f3f4/a024d0fb63a69ec9e841435a690430b5/enabling-practices-cover.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F3e0cshhzqlmj%2F1Jjv4aaEu48Zr5Uh65txmH%2F442343df16e81912ec35fc6af1f18986%2Fenabling-practices-cover.jpg&a=w%3D150%26h%3D194%26fm%3Djpg%26q%3D75&cd=2024-06-05T21%3A53%3A39.982Z 150w,/_gatsby/image/1e8c4e88d9a7bc28374e7c0cbd78f3f4/29e58d05ddafa3f3e7ac1191bf46da06/enabling-practices-cover.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F3e0cshhzqlmj%2F1Jjv4aaEu48Zr5Uh65txmH%2F442343df16e81912ec35fc6af1f18986%2Fenabling-practices-cover.jpg&a=w%3D300%26h%3D388%26fm%3Djpg%26q%3D75&cd=2024-06-05T21%3A53%3A39.982Z 300w,/_gatsby/image/1e8c4e88d9a7bc28374e7c0cbd78f3f4/35587aaeb4ce3dec7db383aa4e17500f/enabling-practices-cover.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F3e0cshhzqlmj%2F1Jjv4aaEu48Zr5Uh65txmH%2F442343df16e81912ec35fc6af1f18986%2Fenabling-practices-cover.jpg&a=w%3D600%26h%3D776%26fm%3Djpg%26q%3D75&cd=2024-06-05T21%3A53%3A39.982Z 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":600,"height":776,"backgroundColor":"rgb(248,248,248)"}}},"worksSectionTitle":null,"works":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"bb990043-a3db-5144-8830-58427e044bd3","title":"2023-2024"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
