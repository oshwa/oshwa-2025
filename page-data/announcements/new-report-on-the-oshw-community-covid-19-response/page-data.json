The report examines how the open source hardware community came together to produce lifesaving medical equipment at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the role of government authorities in that process. It finds that although some parts of the government tried to facilitate the community, in most cases there was a mismatch between what the government expected and what the OSHW community was doing. Nevertheless, the OSHW community significantly augmented the availability of medical supplies through their grassroots response. The report also provides lessons learned and recommendations to help the community and government agencies better respond to future crises together.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"}],\"nodeType\":\"document\"}","references":[]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cdb13f77-cab4-51c7-9614-7862fd9f8506","title":"New Report on the OSHW Community COVID-19 Response"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3016634669","3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
