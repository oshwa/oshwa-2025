In the DIYBio context, there has been a lot of open-source hardware development stemming for a diverse collaboration: our communities were welcoming artists, designers, engineers, cooks, filmmakers, etc. I understand very well the synergies when interweaving diversity, the passion to make, and the struggle to release open-source in a capitalistic world. One of the devices that I contributed to, OpenDrop, has been published in an academic venue, released open-source on github, and has now over hundreds of replicas around the world. Prestigious labs, such as from MIT and UW, forked the device to create a new biochip for DNA computing and liquid display.
