The fellows were chosen by the program’s mentors and an OSHWA\\nboard selection committee. Eliceiri says “There is already widespread community support for making the\\nprotocols for any published scientific study open and carefully documented but the hardware used for most experiments whether homebuilt or commercial can often be effectively a black box. In this age of the quest for reproducible quantitative science the open source concept should be applied to the complete system including hardware, not just the software used to analyze the resulting data.Universities often try to recover the costs associated with developing new scientific instrumentation through patenting, commercialization and startups. This\\nprocess works well at times. But for some highly specialized instrumentation, the traditional model can be too time consuming and costly. Thus, some highly useful innovations never reach other labs.Open hardware and sharing designs for instruments without patenting — as an alternative to the traditional model — is growing in popularity. Three open hardware journals have come of age in the past five years, offering venues to share how to build\\nresearch instrumentation that can be tweaked for a specific use, instead of starting from scratch. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"With open hardware, anyone can replicate or reuse hardware design files for free and this increases the accessibility of hardware tools such as specialized microscopes.The infrastructure of desktop 3D printers is another example of how open hardware can accelerate and broaden scientific research. The National Institute of\\nHealth (NIH)’s 3D Print Exchange is a library designed to advance biomedical research by allowing a researcher to print hardware on site. With local production, there is a reduction in cost and supply chain vulnerabilities.Since 2000, Eliceiri has been lead investigator of his lab known as the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation (LOCI), with a research focus developing novel optical imaging methods for investigating cell signaling and cancer progression, and the development of software for multidimensional image analysis.
