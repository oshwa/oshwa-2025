In that paper, they suggest a tactic of analyzing the central metaphors of a certain class of designs (in the present case, CAD tools), pick alternative metaphors, and explore how the designs would look differently when developed with the alternative metaphor in mind. Applied to the context of 3D printing, we might see the central metaphor of desktop 3D printers as precision and fidelity to the digital model. Then, we might pick an alternative metaphor, like the ability to let the non-human forces shape the outcome, and develop an alternative system, say, a system in which you become the machine executing the 3D printer.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"}],\"nodeType\":\"document\"}","references":[]},"shortDescription":{"shortDescription":"What would happen if we designed CAD systems like a weaver designs cloth?
