Licensing is a way to give people rights that they wouldn’t otherwise have to use your intellectual property (IP) and, in return, to place restrictions on how they exercise those rights. Licensing is often used for copyrighted information, which includes the source-code to computer programs, the text of books, photographs, recordings of music, etc. By placing an open-source license on a copyrighted work, you give people permission to make copies of it — a right they wouldn’t otherwise have. In return, you can require them to, for example, license derivatives of your work under the same license (a condition known as “copyleft”).

Mostly, that is because copyright does not apply to hardware in the way that it does to software. In the United States (as well as many other nations), useful or functional objects are excluded from the scope of copyright protection. (The expression of the objects in a design file, however, may be covered by copyright. More on that below.) Functional objects can be protected by patents but applying for a patent is an expensive and time-consuming process — in contrast to copyright, which applies automatically. As a result, many potentially patentable items will not actually get patented.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"The line between “creative” works protected by copyright and “useful” works protected by patent can be blurry sometimes (\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{\"uri\":\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title17/html/USCODE-2011-title17-chap1-sec102.htm\"},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"17 U.S.C. § 102\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"hyperlink\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\" contains the definition of the distinction). However, a good rule of thumb is that anything in a piece of hardware that is critical to its operations – that means servos, arms, and sensors as opposed to cool flames on the side – falls on the “useful” side of the line. Without a patent, that hardware (except for the software and non-functional design elements) will not be protected by an intellectual property right. Without an underlying intellectual property right, no one needs permission to copy, modify, or build upon the hardware. This means that they do not need a license from the creator and, therefore, license terms (like “copyleft” terms) generally cannot be enforced.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"It is crucial, however, to make a distinction between the design files for the hardware and the hardware itself. The design files are likely protected by copyright, even if the hardware itself is not. (A potential exception is if there is only one or only a handful of ways to express the functional ideas of the hardware in the design file. In that case the expression may “merge” with the ideas and not be protectable by copyright.) Copying the design files (potentially including doing so as a step in making the hardware) would be copyright infringement, while using the design files as a basis to create the hardware in a way that did not copy the files would not be.
